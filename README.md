# flumeview-keyvalue

A flumeview that maps to a key:value view, but not explicitly ordered.
by making ordering insignificant, the view becomes a lot more cacheable!

I created this, because I needed a index in the browser for keys
that was a lot faster that
[flumeview-idb](https://github.com/flumedb/flumeview-idb) was giving me.
